This is a set of dummy/sample ada projects. Each folders contains
a .gpr file that allows the compilation of each project in a stand-alone
fashion. GNAT 6.3.0 was used (apt-get install gnat).
To compile each project just navigate to the project folder and
execute 'gprbuild' this will take each project config and will build
the program.
